   <p> Hey there! Welcome :)
     <br>
   <br> My name is Shayan Edalatmanesh. I'm a PhD student in theoretical physical chemistry, currently working at <a href="https://nanosurf.fzu.cz/">Nanosurf lab</a> in Prague, Czech Republic. I study the electronic structure and the properties of nanomaterials, mainly with density functional theory.
     <br>
     <br>I also do simulations of scanning probe microscopy (AFM, STM and KPFM), and (co)-develop the Probe-Particle STM simulation code.
